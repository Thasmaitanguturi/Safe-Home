The project is designed to develop an Intelligent Automated Real-Time Surveillance System that enhances traditional CCTV functionalities by integrating features such as face recognition, anti-theft detection, motion detection, and monitoring of restricted areas. It is intended for environments requiring enhanced security measures, providing real-time alerts and notifications to ensure proactive incident response and comprehensive protection. The system predominantly uses Python libraries and machine learning algorithms for real-time analysis and response.


## Features

- Person Identification
- Anti-Theft Property
- Motion Detection
- Restricted Area Monitoring
- Recording
- In and Out Monitoring
- Notifications(Alerts)




## Usage
#### Person Identification:
This feature uses facial recognition to identify individuals in the video. It helps quickly recognize authorized personnel and detect intruders, enhancing security by ensuring only known individuals are granted access.

#### Anti-Theft Property:
The anti-theft feature detects unauthorized access or suspicious activities in real-time. It triggers alerts to prevent theft or breaches, helping to protect valuable assets and property from unauthorized access.

#### Motion Detection:
Motion detection continuously monitors the surveillance area for any movement. When motion is detected, it promptly alerts the system, allowing for immediate review and response. This feature is crucial for detecting and addressing potential security threats as they happen.

#### Restricted Area Monitoring:
This feature ensures that only authorized individuals access designated restricted zones. By monitoring these areas and generating alerts for any unauthorized entry, it helps maintain high security and prevents unauthorized access to sensitive or critical regions.

#### Recording:
The recording feature captures and stores all surveillance footage, providing a comprehensive log of activities within the monitored area. This stored footage can be reviewed and analyzed later for security audits, investigations, and evidence collection, ensuring a reliable record of events.

#### In and Out Monitoring:
In and out monitoring tracks and logs the entry and exit of individuals within the surveillance area. This feature maintains accurate records of movement, aiding in tracking attendance, ensuring compliance with security protocols, and identifying unauthorized entries or exits.
